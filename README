Expense Tracker PhoneGap

This is a sample mobile application built with PhoneGap. Not intended to run as
production level code. Please do not hold your breath waiting to be impressed
with this code. This is supposed to be a very basic DB CRUD app, nothing fancy
or impressive. Expense Tracker PhoneGap includes a copy of jQuery Mobile.
